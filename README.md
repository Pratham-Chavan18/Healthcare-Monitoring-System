# Healthcare Monitoring System

## Project info
The Simple Healthcare Monitoring System is a lightweight, web-based application
designed to collect and monitor basic health metrics such as heart rate, body
temperature, and oxygen saturation from simulated input sources. The platform
allows healthcare providers to view real-time patient data, receive alerts when values
go beyond safe thresholds, and analyze trends through a dashboard. This project
demonstrates the integration of key DevOps practices like infrastructure automation,
continuous delivery, monitoring, and containerization in a simplified healthcare
setting.
